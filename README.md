### SPEAKERS

**Gemma Barlow, Lead iOS Engineer at Harry's**

**Natalie Podrazik, "Body Talk", or watchOS 3** 

Talk: Apple WatchOS and their Apps: What do they do? How do they do things? Let's Find Out! I dove into watchOS 3 and made an app called "Body Talk" to track and export health symptoms and I have lots to say about it. 

Bio: Natalie is an iOS Developer who most recently worked at Byte on the Peach and Byte apps. She also runs [CocoaHeads NYC](http://www.cocoaheadsnyc.org/) and is totally pumped that this Women in iOS group exists.
