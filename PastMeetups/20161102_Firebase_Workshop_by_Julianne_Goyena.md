**Working with Firebase,  Julianne Goyena**

Julianne Goyena is currently building a tvOS app for IROKO Partners, a global African entertainment company located in Times Square. She also heads the Twitter Dev Community here in NYC. She'll be giving a workshop on Firebase, an easy way to implement a back end in your iOS apps. This will be a lesson on the basics, so great for beginners and iOS developers who have never used it before. 

We will be adding Firebase to one of Julianne's already existing projects, Meet Geek, which won the $1000 prize at the ladies Seat Geek hackathon. So in addition to learning Firebase, it will be a good practice for reading other people's code. 

**NB:** 

• Please bring your own computer.

• Before the hackathon please sign up for a Firebase account.

• We will be forking a Github repo, so it would be useful to have an account, but not necessary.
