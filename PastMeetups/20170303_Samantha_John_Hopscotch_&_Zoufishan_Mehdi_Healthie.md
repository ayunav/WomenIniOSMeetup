# SPEAKERS: 

## Singletons always get you in the end: why dependency injection is awesome, and made even awesomer with Swift

## Samantha John,  Co-Founder at Hopscotch Technologies 

We'll talk about the problems dependency injection can solve using real-world examples from the Hopscotch code. Then go over how you can implement this pattern in Swift with minimal disruption of your current code base. 

Sam is the co-founder of Hopscotch, an app that teaches kids to code. She's been programming in iOS since 2012 and using Swift basically since it came out of beta. Likes to think she's gained some wisdom along the way.

## Submitting your App to the App Store

## Zoufishan Mehdi, iOS developer at Healthie 

Your product is ready but now what? 

iOS developer Zoufishan Mehdi will walk you through shipping your product to the App Store and lessons learned.

Zoufishan is an iOS developer at Healthie. She started her iOS development journey at Coalition for Queens’ Access Code program.

With a background in security and foreign languages, she was always curious about delving into the unknown. While analyzing her MA thesis in cybersecurity from a theoretical perspective, she became interested in the nuances that were amiss without the technical know-how. For her, that was the spark that would eventually help make sense of the world of theory with logic.
