# SPEAKERS: 

**Why am I building this product?**

**Maria Perez, Product Manager, Creative SDK for iOS, Adobe**

I make digital ideas happen. With over 14 years of experience as a product leader, I’ve built a track record of online products that solve everyday real needs. I am a deep believer that strategy and execution are the key to the success of any idea. Iteration, measurement and feedback are essential to anything you put in practice. I’m somewhere between a coach and a translator when it comes to meet teams and business requirements. After been exploring my entrepreneurial side — building my own product while experience the adventure of growing a business, I now work for Adobe, where I learn how to improve creative tools everyday. 

Simplicity is key. Keep it simple and enjoy the way.

I will share essential tips on how to make the right choices when building a product.

**Code Organization** 

**Jenny Chang, iOS Engineer at GRUBHUB** 

At GRUBHUB, we have inherited a large legacy code base and to support two brands, we built on top of the existing code base. As the code base grows, we needed a way for the iOS team to become more productive and effective in developing features for our diner app. I have tackled the challenge of helping the team increase in productivity by means of reorganizing the large code base. Learn about the different proposals and how I convinced the team on the new file structure. 

Jenny Chang Ho is an iOS engineer at GRUBHUB. She moved from Canada almost a year ago to chase her dreams of working in a startup-like environment where people and food are very good friends. Technology help build the strong relationship.
