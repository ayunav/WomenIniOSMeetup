# SPEAKERS: 

## Intro to User Notifications in iOS 10

## Paola Mata, iOS Developer at BuzzFeed

With iOS 10, Apple introduced two exciting frameworks for working with user notifications. In this talk, I will give an overview of how notifications work, walk through the basics of the new frameworks, and offer tips for best practices to get you easily up and running with supporting notifications in your applications.

Paola is an iOS developer, social media addict, and occasional blogger based in Brooklyn.  She is currently building awesome apps at BuzzFeed, where she was part of the team that launched the highly acclaimed BuzzFeed News app. Paola is also actively involved in the tech community as co-founder of NYC Tech Latinas and regularly volunteers her time to promoting diversity in tech and supporting the next wave of new programmers.

## Cassandra Shum and Carson Ramsden, ThoughtWorks 

## Mobile Design Patterns: Pros and Cons

We are discussing our previous experiences on different IOS projects and addressing the potential pitfalls of too many options in design patterns.  When too many design patterns are implemented, we show how things can go horribly wrong, and how they can be avoided while still benefiting from the range of design patterns available. 

Cassandra is a Lead Consultant with ThoughtWorks, who has primarily been leading and working in a variety of mobile projects. She has primarily been involved in IOS, Android and Mobile web applications that are supported on multiple devices. She is also one of the leaders in the initiative to organize the women's group in ThoughtWorks and is also involved in promoting more female speakers in technology.
