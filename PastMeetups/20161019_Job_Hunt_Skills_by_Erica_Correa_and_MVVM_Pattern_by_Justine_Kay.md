### SPEAKERS

**Erica Correa, iOS Developer at XO Group Inc.**

**Job Hunt Skills**

Erica Correa is a former language teacher turned junior developer at XO Group Inc. She started out learning foreign languages, including Spanish and Italian, then moved onto computer languages and can’t get enough. She decided to become an iOS developer because she’s in love with (and common-law married to) her iPhone. 

She’ll be talking to us about her serious job-hunt skills and how she got three job offers without filling out a single application. Erica will provide tips and tricks of the job hunt and provide information regarding the tech interview process. Since Erica is a bootcamp graduate and an advocate for women in tech, she’ll be available to answer any questions that any junior devs have as well as any women interested in starting their careers in tech.

**Justine Kay, iOS Developer at Intrepid Pursuits**

**The MVVM Pattern** 

Justine is a junior iOS engineer at Intrepid Pursuits (Intrepid.io) specializing in Swift. She is also an alumna of the Coalition for Queens Access Code program in iOS development (c4q.nyc).

With a background in conceptual art and photography, she inadvertently avoided programming most of her life, believing it to be a predictable and much too logical profession. It wasn’t until she started experimenting with web development out of a desire to make a big career change that she realized just how abstract, conceptual, and intellectually satisfying it actually is. That was when she fell in love.

She’ll be talking about the design pattern MVVM and how it can be utilized to write highly readable and easier to maintain code.
