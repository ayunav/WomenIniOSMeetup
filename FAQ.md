### Why do we need to make an event only for women, when we are trying to embrace equality?

iOSoho, the largest iOS meetup in NYC, has an audience that is about 90% male. iOSoho has never had women speakers.

The Women in iOS meetup is about creating a safe and comfortable environment for women and other underrepresented groups in the iOS development industry. We understand that, for some, it might be intimidating to attend a meetup where they could be the only “other” person in the room. 

For example, according to one iOSoho attendee, “when I signed up for my first iOSoho event, frankly, I didn’t want to go. There were 12 women, including me, on that 150 person guest list, and I was scared and intimidated to walk into that room.” 

Through the Women in iOS meetup, we hope to diversify the iOS community by encouraging  more women and other minority groups to join the larger iOSoho group and to speak at iOSoho.
